Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a model trained on one task is reused or adapted as the starting point for a model on a second related task. It leverages knowledge gained while solving one problem and applies it to a different but related problem. This approach has gained immense popularity and proven to be highly effective, particularly in domains where labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain.

The main idea behind transfer learning is inspired by how humans learn. When we learn to perform a new task, we often leverage our knowledge and skills acquired from previous experiences. For example, if you've learned to classify different types of fruits, you might find it easier to learn to classify vegetables because you can transfer your understanding of features like shape, color, and texture.
